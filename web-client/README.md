# Devtools Web Client

This is the Web-Client for the devtools app. It communicates with Rust instrumentation layer via WebSockets. It is a SolidJS Single-Page Application (SPA).

## Running Locally ðŸ’»

Change directory into `web-client` and install dependencies.

```sh
cd web-client && pnpm install
```

Now you're ready to run and access it from [localhost]()

```sh
pnpm dev
```

The client itself does very little without an app to receive data from, so at another terminal session, change directory into `./examples/tauri`

```sh
cd examples/tauri
```

And run the app with the `--inspect` flag:

```sh
cargo run -- --inspect
```

Watch out for the terminal, the app will let you know the Web Sockets URL to listen to.

## Stack ðŸ“¦

Here is a list of the tools used to build the core functionality and links to each of their documentation pages.

### SolidJS

JSX based reactivity library for building user interfaces.

#### Routing

We follow the flat File-System Architecture, route definitions currently live inside `src/entry.tsx`.

#### Web Sockets

Communication with the Rust instrumentation is done via Web Sockets and uses the SolidJS Web Sockets primitive, with SolidJS EventListeners primitive to convert DOM Events into signals.
