# DevTools

This is the Web-Client for the devtools app. It receives instrumentation data from the [devtools](https://docs.rs/devtools/latest/devtools) crate.

The Web-Client is a solid Single-Page Application (SPA).

Check it live: [devtools.crabnebula.dev](https://devtools.crabnebula.dev)

## Running Locally ðŸ’»

After cloning the repository, change directory into `web-client` and install dependencies.

```sh
cd web-client && pnpm install
```

Now you're ready to run and access it from [localhost](http://localhost:5173/)

```sh
pnpm dev
```

The client itself does very little without an app to receive data from, so at another terminal session, change directory into `./examples/tauri`

```sh
cd examples/tauri
```

## Setup your Tauri App ðŸ¦€

```rs
fn main() {
    let devtools_plugin = devtools::init();

    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(devtools_plugin)
        .setup(|_| {
            // It is compatible with the `tracing` ecosystem!
            tracing::info!("Hello World!");

            Ok(())
        })
         // ... the rest of the tauri setup code
}
```

With the plugin added, you can start serving your app. The instrumentation server is exposed in `127.0.0.1:3030` by default.
