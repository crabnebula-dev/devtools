    'The Tauri configuration object. It is read from a file where you can define your frontend assets, configure the bundler, enable the app updater, define a system tray, enable APIs via the allowlist and more.\n\nThe configuration file is generated by the [`tauri init`](https://tauri.app/v1/api/cli#init) command that lives in your Tauri application source directory (src-tauri).\n\nOnce generated, you may modify it at will to customize your Tauri application.\n\n## File Formats\n\nBy default, the configuration is defined as a JSON file named `tauri.conf.json`.\n\nTauri also supports JSON5 and TOML files via the `config-json5` and `config-toml` Cargo features, respectively. The JSON5 file name must be either `tauri.conf.json` or `tauri.conf.json5`. The TOML file name is `Tauri.toml`.\n\n## Platform-Specific Configuration\n\nIn addition to the default configuration file, Tauri can read a platform-specific configuration from `tauri.linux.conf.json`, `tauri.windows.conf.json`, and `tauri.macos.conf.json` (or `Tauri.linux.toml`, `Tauri.windows.toml` and `Tauri.macos.toml` if the `Tauri.toml` format is used), which gets merged with the main configuration object.\n\n## Configuration Structure\n\nThe configuration is composed of the following objects:\n\n- [`package`](#packageconfig): Package settings - [`tauri`](#tauriconfig): The Tauri config - [`build`](#buildconfig): The build configuration - [`plugins`](#pluginconfig): The plugins config\n\n```json title="Example tauri.config.json file" { "build": { "beforeBuildCommand": "", "beforeDevCommand": "", "devPath": "../dist", "distDir": "../dist" }, "package": { "productName": "tauri-app", "version": "0.1.0" }, "tauri": { "allowlist": { "all": true }, "bundle": {}, "security": { "csp": null }, "updater": { "active": false }, "windows": [ { "fullscreen": false, "height": 600, "resizable": true, "title": "Tauri App", "width": 800 } ] } } ```',
